Java Programming Repository
This repository is a comprehensive collection of programs, examples, and projects written in the Java programming language.

It is designed as a structured learning resource and practical reference for understanding core Java concepts, object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, and fundamental data structures and algorithms.

Key Topics Covered
The project is organized to cover essential areas of Java development:

Core Java Fundamentals: Syntax, data types, control structures (loops, conditionals), and basic I/O.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Deep dives into Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, and Abstraction.

Collections Framework: Examples using ArrayList, HashMap, HashSet, and other utility classes.

Data Structures & Algorithms: Implementation of common structures like Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, and classic algorithms.

Exception Handling: Best practices for try-catch-finally blocks and custom exceptions.

Multithreading: Concepts and examples of creating and managing thread

To explore and run the Java programs in this repository, follow these steps.

Prerequisites

You need the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system to compile and run the programs.

1. Clone the Repository
